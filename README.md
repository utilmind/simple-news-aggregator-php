Very simple news aggregator website using PHP

This script was made 28.11.2018 as simple demo of RSS feed aggregator
(that downloads RSS feeds from an array of specific sources and aggregates them into single news feed).

Now, 23.01.2019, I just want to share it to public. No updates planned, just uploading it as is.
